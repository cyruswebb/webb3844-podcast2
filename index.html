    <h1><font color="BBFF33">Podcasts: Part Two</font></h1>
    <h2><i><font color="FF9333">Serial</font></i></h2>
    <h3><font color="FFD433">Summary</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Serial</i> is one of the more famous Podcasts on the internet, but prior to this assignment I had not yet listened to a single episode of <i>Serial</i>. <i>Serial</i> creates a unique podcast that blends the use of narrative with the employment of interviews. <i>Serial</i> reviews a 1999 Baltimore murder conviction and, in great detail, examines whether the convicted killer, Adnan, was mispronounced guilty. The podcast is broken up into 12 installments, with each episode examining the trial from a certain perspective or focusing on a certain aspect of the trial evidence. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="FFD433">Structure</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The narrator, Sarah Koenig, is an investigative journalist and acts as the narrator, steering the direction of the podcast while simultaneously interviewing subjects and contributing her own personal insight into the case. Sarah gives the podcast life, as she is not merely a passive storyteller but rather an active one that is not afraid to let the reader know how she reacts to a particular piece of new evidence. However, Sarah is far from the only voice heard on the podcast as he interviews a plethora of individuals that are relevant to the case to get their opinion and she also includes old police interview recordings.  </li>
        <li>The most fascinating aspect of <i>Serial</i> is the structure that is takes, as certain parts are scripted while most of the interviews are not. This mixture of scripted and conversational content allows for the podcast to be both formal and informal, making it very easy and enjoyable to listen to. It also gives it a very literary bent, as it feels like you are listening to an audiobook when Sarah is reading to you and a conversation when she interviewing someone. This subsequently leads to <i>Serial</i> becoming a podcast that is a combination of narrative techniques and interviews. So, while the podcast relies on interviews, it is more narrative based, relying on the interviews merely to contribute to the narrative growth of the podcast. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="FFD433">Sound Effects</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In regards to sound effects, <i>Serial</i> does not rely all that heavily on the use of added sound. Aside from the interview and cellphone recordings used in the podcast, <i>Serial</i> really does not incorporate sound into the podcast all that much. There is a theme song of sorts that plays at times when the podcast seems to be reaching the end of a particular argument of a minor climax, but music is relatively absent and does not play all that large of a role in the podcast.  </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><i><font color="FF9333">S-Town</font></i></h2>
    <h3><font color="FFD433">Summary</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><i>S-Town</i> has quickly become one of the more enjoyable podcasts that I have ever listened to and I plan on listening to the rest of the series after hearing the first episode. The podcast is laid out in a very similar manner to <i>Serial</i>; however, whereas <i>Serial</i> reviews a murder trial from the 1990s, <i>S-Town</i> examines the possibility that a murder occurred in rural Alabama that did not go to trial. The most fascinating aspect of <i>S-Town</i> though is the look that the podcast provides into rural life in the modern deep south. While <i>Serial</i> focuses almost solely on reviewing a previous murder trial, <i>S-Town</i> looks at the possibility a murder was convicted while simultaneously examining the dark side of a mostly forgotten area of the US. Similar to <i>Serial</i>, <i>S-Town</i> combines the use of narrative with the compilation of a set of interviews to tell a story that is both fascinating and multi-faceted.  </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="FFD433">Structure</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Similar to Sarah Koenig in <i>Serial</i>, Brian Reed acts as the narrator of <i>S-Town</i>. Brian and Sarah are both investigative journalists that work for the same company; however, I found that Brian tended to insert his own personal opinion into the conversation with far greater regularity than Sarah, giving <i>S-Town</i> a feeling not all that dissimilar from a memoir. Like in <i>Serial</i>, Brian too relies on the incorporation of interviews with local townspeople, but he relies particularly heavily on conversations with John McLemore and the podcast, at times, feels like one big interview between the two men. There is also a noticeable absence of police recordings in <i>S-Town</i> which I found to be a major distinction between it and <i>Serial</i>.</li>
        <li>The structure of <i>S-Town</i> is also strikingly similar to <i>Serial</i> as each podcast seemingly combines the use of narrative with a collection of interviews. However, I seemed to find that <i>S-Town</i> was much more conversational than <i>Serial</i> as it placed a far greater emphasis on conversations between Brian and John. I also found that <i>S-Town</i> was less formal than <i>Serial</i> and, while partially scripted, lacked as much scripting as <i>Serial</i>. All in all, I felt that interviews seemed to play a slightly greater role than narrative structure in <i>S-Town</i>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="FFD433">Sound Effects</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In regards to sound effects, I felt that <i>S-Town</i> relied on the use of background music to a greater degree than did <i>Serial</i>. While both certainly did not place all that large of a focus on music, I felt that <i>S-Town</i> attempted to construct more of a theme through the use of folk music than did <i>Serial</i> which I found more powerful. </li>
    </ul>
